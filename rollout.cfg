// Rollout scripts
// ???Laz

// Usage: 'exec rollout'

// Set up the server (These are for use in offline practice mode).
// Change 'net_fakelag' to whatever your ping normally is.
alias setupserver "mp_tournament 1; sv_allow_wait_command 1; sv_cheats 1; net_fakelag 20"

// All the stuff for rolling out.
// Change hurt me to whatever buff you want
// this will vary for pocket (-200 is probably a good bet), -180ish for demo
// Use more if you want to jump in setup
alias reroll "mp_restartgame 1; wait 1000; hurtme -180"

// Change the bind here
bind f reroll

// Exec the setup commands
